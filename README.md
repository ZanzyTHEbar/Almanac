## Smart Air Filter Project Controller

## :cat: Air Filter Project for Cats and Home :cat2:

This repo is dedicated to the **Smart Air Filter Project**, an automated system for purifying cat litter air.

## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT

This project is dedicated to designing PCB and programming files to bring Smart Air Filtering to the DIY community. Using water as the filtration medium, no need for expensive consumable filters. 

## Things to Do

**__Hardware__**

- [x] Formulate project as PlatformIO
- [x] Integrate the PCB schematic layout
- [x] Integrate a BOM parts list for PCB
- [x] Integrate a Pick and Place file
- [ ] Integrate Panelised PCB gerber files
- [ ] Integrate SPI SRAM chip instead of SD Card
- [ ] Integrate speakers for audio feedback

**__Software__**

- [x] Implement proper memory management
- [ ] Implement proper error handling&logging
- [ ] Implement proper documentation
- [ ] Implement proper debugging for testing
- [ ] Add custom sounds for speakers
- [x] implement code as proper custom library
- [ ] implement dual core system archtecture
        --> Networking on one core and Application code on the other (esp32 is dual core)
