**Stratum Defined**

In an agroforestry system, plants occupy different levels depending on the amount of direct sunlight
they need.
The names of these levels in order are; emergent, high, medium and low.

- `Emergent`

Plants that thrive on full sun and donâ€™t tolerate shade. They reach above the top level of surrounding plants. Often, but not always an elongated shaped tree or plant.

- `High`

Plants that enjoy full sun, but tolerate a small amount of shade. They form the top level.

- `Medium`

Plants that thrive on a mix of sun and shade. They do poorly in full sun or full shade. They form
the middle level.

- `Low`

Plants that thrive in shade and filtered sun. They form the low level.
