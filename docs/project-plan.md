# Updated Project Plan for Garden Management System

## Project Structure

### File Structure

- `main.py`: Setup and configure FastAPI application, including middleware for authentication using Supabase.
- `models/`: Using SQLModel to define entities such as plants, sensors, and actuators.
- `schemas/`: Pydantic models for data validation and client interaction.
- `services/`: Core business logic, such as gardening algorithms and CRUD operations.
- `api/`: Define FastAPI endpoints for various features (Garden, Journal, Todo, etc.).
- `auth/`: Authentication services integrating with Supabase for user management.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Initial Configuration

- **Initialize Project with Poetry**
  - Set up the project using Poetry.
  - Define Python version and initial dependencies.
- **Setup Supabase Integration**
  - Configure authentication and database access through Supabase.
  - Establish initial database schema on Supabase.
- **Basic API Structure with FastAPI**
  - Create `main.py` to setup FastAPI application routes and middleware.
  - Define initial models and schemas using SQLModel and Pydantic.

## Phase 2: API Development and Business Logic Implementation

- **Implement CRUD Operations**
  - Develop services for CRUD operations on plants, tasks, and journal entries.
  - Integrate these services with FastAPI endpoints.
- **Authentication Services**
  - Implement user authentication and management using Supabase's API.
- **Core Algorithms Implementation**
  - Develop the frost and harvest algorithms within the services layer.

## Phase 3: Frontend Development with SolidJS

- **Build Frontend Architecture**
  - Set up the project structure with SolidJS (components, pages, store).
- **Develop Interactive UI Components**
  - Create dynamic forms, calendars, and journal interfaces.
  - Implement real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions.
- **Connect Frontend to Backend**
  - Develop services in SolidJS to interact with FastAPI backend.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features and AI Integration

- **Integrate AI Features**
  - Implement CrewAI and LangChain for garden layout generation and chat functionalities.
  - Set up AI-driven predictions and recommendations based on garden data.
- **Enhance Garden Dashboard**
  - Develop dashboard widgets and real-time displays for sensor and weather data.

## Phase 5: Testing, Documentation, and Deployment

- **Testing**
  - Conduct backend tests with pytest covering all functionalities.
  - Perform frontend testing using Jest and ensure compatibility with SolidJS.
- **Documentation**
  - Generate API documentation automatically using FastAPI's Swagger.
  - Maintain comprehensive Markdown documentation for both users and developers.
- **Deployment**
  - Containerize the application using Docker.
  - Prepare for deployment, optionally using Kubernetes for scalability.
